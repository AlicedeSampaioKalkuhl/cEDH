# cEDH
 analysis scripts and results for the cEDH meta project

The cEDH Metagame project is a brilliant initiative by [James (@Squirrelmob)](https://twitter.com/SquirrelmobMTG). I want to encourage anyone who sees this repository to also read James' reports. 

You can read the intro to the project [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t_-89an_XPluNzyVRTEjZsrPYykEP5EXQRce3HxkUSw/edit). 

In this Github repository you can find my ideas in the metagame folder that contains an R project with a knitr markdown file. 

# Why this GitHub respository? 

I like to analyse meta data in R. In general, I find it useful to generate some basic statistics and pretty, colour-blind-friendly graphs. I also want to make this a place where the community can provide stats and data visualisation ideas in addition to James' brilliant project. 

Please shoot me a [twitter dm](https://twitter.com/quantumlandbook), if you want to add your own code or transform some of the raw data from update 4.6 or earlier into clean additions.
